/*
Vowels

Write a method that will take a string and
return an array of vowels used in that string.

Example:
count_vowels("The quick brown fox") should return ["e","u","i","o","o"]
count_vowels("Hello World") should return ["e","o","o"]

Check your solution by running the tests:
mocha 12_vowels.js

function vowels (string) {
    // Your code here
}

module.exports = vowels_test
